# RTonIMDB2
A userscript which grabs score data from rottentomates and embeds it on IMDB pages. Currently works for movies and TV movies, TV shows may be implemented in the future though I feel rottentomatoes is mostly releavent for movies.

The script doesn't rely on third party APIs (e.g. OMDb api) which I've found to be slow to get data on newer titles, and without using the official rotten tomates api which isn't feasible to gain access to. It works reliabley most of the time, though may produce strange results when on obscure titles or titles without rotten tomates pages.

This is a refactor of an older private project, RTonIMDB.
